# laptop-price-prediction-models
Predict laptop prices using Python, scikit-learn, and XGBoost.
This project applies various machine learning regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, etc.) to predict the price of laptops. The dataset includes features such as brand, processor type, RAM size, storage configuration, GPU brand, and more. The goal is to compare model performances and build a robust predictor.
